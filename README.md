# Arduino-bluetooth-based-RC-car-with-servo-steering

[+] This project uses "Bluetooth RC Controller" Android App📱 for RC operations🕹.

[+] It uses L293D Motor driver shield🛡 which is used to interface arduino with DC Motors and servos.
   > L298N Motor Driver Module can also be used to serve the above purpose.

[+] It has actual steering mechanism where Servo motor is used for so.

[+] There is another servo which will be used for opening and closing the doors🚪.

[+] Make sure all the components and shield are not connected to the arduino while uploading the code👩‍💻.

[+] After uploading, then make the connections and solder pins 0 & 1 to the Arduino Uno board.
   > Not needed for L298N Motor Driver Module. Here they will directly go to the Arduino Uno without soldering.

[+] These will go to the communication📡 (TX & RX) pins of the Bluetooth module.

[+] Make rest of the connections and then give the power supply⚡ to the Shield.
   
   >> Connections may differ slightly between L293D Motor Driver Shield🛡 and L298N Motor Driver Module <<
